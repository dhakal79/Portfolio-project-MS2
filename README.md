# Unit Operation in Water Treatment 
Welcome! [IHE Delft](http://un-ihe.org)
## Introduction
IHE Delft Institute for Water Education is the largest international water education facility in the world. Its mission is to contribute to water related research and the education of water professionals. IHE Delft has provided graduate education to more than 15,000 water professionals from 162 countries. Over 150 PhD fellows are currently enrolled in water-related research and more than 120 water research and capacity development projects are carried out throughout the world. Due to COVID-19, IHE Delft is making education online if possible for all the modules. Within this new policy framework, I am going to make my module"unit operation in water treatment" online. This module has four componets coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and dissolved air floatation. 

The overall aim of this project is to make online the componennt "coagulation" which I involve for teaching. 

A live website can be found [here](https://dhakal79.github.io/Portfolio-project-MS1/).

# 1. User Expereince (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on university teaching is to turn face to face teaching to online learning. It was a challenge for lecturer to switch all face to face teaching to online learning. This project is aimed to provide a platform where students can learn online for a module name" 
  unit operation in water treatment". 

  The following users types can be benifitted from the website:

* Professionals dealing with engineering, management and education in the fields of water supply and wastewater and urban infrastructure.
* Post graduate students in environmental engineering. 
* Participants from government organisations ( both local and national agencies), non-governmental organisations and the private sector. 
 

<a name="user-goals"></a>
## 1.1 User Goals
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The main goal of this website is to provide in depth theory about coagulation process in drinking water treatment. I want to provide information about coagulation to the target audience.


<a name="user-expectations"></a>
## 1.2 User Expectations
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The website content provides state-of-the-art knowledge and experience on the technologies and design practices of conventional water treatment systems. The site can be an ideal for practicing engineers who are working in the water supply and sewerage systems. Folloiwng user's expections are considered while designing the site:
* The site structure is designed considering the expectation of users to be simple and easy to use.
* The user interface is easy to navigate (inlcude main navigation bar, drop dwon menu bar and a link at bottom of page that user can go back to top of the page in just one click).
* Responsive design for all screen/device sizes like mobile, tablet and desktop.
* Feedback/course evalaution page provided where users can provide their comments and suggestion for future improvement
* a link for application provided for those users who will be interested to take this course faceto face at IHE Delft.

## 1.3 Color Scheme
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The choice of website right foreground and background colour is essential that decides the site visitors wheather to emote the site or not. In this design we consider the accessibility guideline i.e, contrast between background and foreground colours. We make use of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)  to select the background and foreground color. Here is an example how the choice of background and foreground is decided to the site.
![color contrast](./assets/images/color-contrast.jpg)

Other foreground and background color used in the sites are
* foreground: #ffffff
* background: #044348

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format. The concept design (wireframes) of webpages (3 pages) prepared is presented below.

  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
 ### All 3 pages:
- Navigation bar is placed at the top right corner of the page, and cosnidered a hover effect that changes the colour (with green box) when we want to click the page. The hover effect is placed to improve the user expereince. 
- Drop down menu bar is provided to the main menu bar of the theory.html page
- Logo of IHE Delft is placed on the top left corner 
- Background color of menu bar and foreground color were chosen considering the contrast between background and foreground colours. We make use of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to select the background and foreground color.
- Social media links (for facebook, Linkden, Twitter and Youtube) are placed at the bottom of the each page in the footer. All the links will open in a new tab. 
- Back to top link provided to each page at the bottom left corner. this will allow the visitor to access to the top oif page in one click.

### Introduction page:
- Water image is included just below the menubar to highlight that this website provides information about water. We provide zoom animation to the image to attract the attention of the user.
- The page contain the title of the module "Unit Operation in Water Treatment" and below which which provided this divisions (using flex properties). The first division (left) provides information about aim of the module, learning objectives, the second division (middle) provides information about when to apply for the course and contact details of the module coordinator. finally, the last division contain a module introduction video (self recorded). 
- An external link "Apply here" provided where interested users can apply for a face to face course.
- Summary of topics to be covered in this module is presented in the bottom of the page (just above the social media link) using the property flex.

The screenshot of introduction page is below:

## 4.1 Testing using tools
### 4.1.1 Google Developer Tools
I make use of google developer tools (Chrome DevTools) as debugging tools. Using this tool i inspect for every elements that I added in HTML and CSS style. Once I was happy with, I copy the CSS style code from Chrome DevTools and paste in my CSS style sheet.

### 4.1.2 Responsive Tools

In order to make sure that design web pages are responsive to all device sizes, [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) site was used to check it. 

### 4.1.3 W3C Validator Tools

[W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) was used to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

![W3C HTML Validation](./assets/images/W3Chtml.jpg)
The HTML checker notified me an error in my index.html page. it suggested that i should consider using h2-h6 elements to the section with id='animation" in the page. 

The identified error was corrected by switching section to div and no error was found as shown in picture below.

### Solved bugs
- When i checked the accessibility of feedback page i discovered i forget to add title to iframe (google map). I solved it by adding title "google map".
- I also discovered that Form elements do not have associated labels. I solved this by adding assoviated labels. 
- I saw a hyphens between social media icons. The problem with &lt;a &gt; tags. The problem was solved by writing in css style sheet that target &lt;a &gt; using text-decoration: none;
